//assert test
        // Create an assert function that accepts an array of integers as an agrument. If the input is an integer return true, if its not throw an error message.


// tests for sum
        // Create a function name sum that accepts an array of integers as an argument
        //Declare a new variable as the running total set equal to zero
        //Create a FOR loop to cycle through each arguments passed to the sum function. Compare each argument until it reaches the length of the argument. Add it to the total
        // Return the running total variable
        // Call the sum function with even numbers
        // Call the sum function with odd numbers



// tests for mean
        // Create a function named mean that accepts an array of integers as an argument
        //Determine a new sum function FOR each integer in the argument. Add it to the total
       //Divide the running total of the argument array by the length of array to determine the mean
        // Return this mean
        // Call the mean function with even numbers
        // Call the mean function with odd numbers


// tests for median
        // Create a function median that accepts an array of integers as an argument
        //Sort the integer from least to greatest
        //Find the length of the integers
        //IF the length of the integer is odd (use Modulous)
        //Find the middle number as Math.round which is integerlength minus 1 divided by 2
        //Return the median value
        //ELSE get the two middle values
        //Calculate the average of the two values
        //Return the median value
        // Call the median function with even numbers
        // Call the median function with odd numbers
