#Think About Time

With this exercise I learned about Time Boxing, The Pomodoro Technique, The Fogg method, The Zone, Flow, Meditation, and Growth Mindset. Time Boxing is a method of time management where work continues for a predetermined amount of time and is then stopped and evaluated at the end of that time.
 I don't really manage my time beyond the most basic of scheduling around deadlines and working until whatever I need to finish is done or I need a break. I will probably change to some variant of Time Boxing as I don't think I would be able to cope with the increased workload and demands of Dev Bootcamp. 
To begin with I will try the Pomodoro Technique with the goal of completing that weeks work as early as possible to leave time for additional research.

#The Command Line

A shell is a command line interpreter and Bash is a shell program written for Unix systems
I found my limited typing skills to be the biggest hurdle in the crash course materials but as far as the actual material goes I did have some difficulty wrapping my mind around the cp command and the naming the full file path for the destination though I did end up getting it after some additional research and testing. The rest of the commands seemed straight forward, for now, and I had no difficulty with them. I felt that the cd, ls and ../ commands were some of the more important command learned so far because while they may not do much they are how one navigates and sees within the various directories.

Pwd – print working directory. Tells you where you are.

Ls – list. Lists the contents of the current directory.

Mv –  Move. Moves a file to a new directory or renames a file.

Cd – Changes directory. Changes the directory you are working in.

../ - Changes up 1 directory, can be chained.

Touch – Generates an empty file.

Mkdir – generates a new directory.

Less – displays the contents of a text file with paging if the file is long enough to require it.

Rmdir – remove directory. Deletes a directory, including it's contents.

Rm – removes a file from within a directory.

Help – displays the help file for a command or, with modifiers, displays a list of various commands. 

#Forking and CLoning

Github instructions:
To create a new repository: 
1. Once you have registered an account go to the accounts main page.
2. In the upper right corner you will see a plus sign to the left of your avatar. Click it and choose “New Repository” from the menu that appears.
3. In the new screen configure the name, privacy settings and license information as you see fit.

To fork a repository:
1. Navigate to the repository you wish to fork.
2. In the upper right corner click the button labeled “Fork”.
3. In the selection box that appears choose the tile that represents where you would like the repository forked to.

To clone a repository:
1. Navigate to the repository you wish to clone.
2. Locate the box that contains the URL for the repository.
3. Open your terminal and cd to to where you would like the repository to be cloned to, making sure it is not within another repository.
4. Type into the terminal “git clone THE URL FOR THE REPOSITORY”.
5. Enter in your github user name and password if prompted.

A repository would be forked rather than creating a new one so that one could contribute to, continue with, or build upon the work already performed by others and saved within that repository.

I found the setting up of git and Github to be relatively straight forward, this may be because I was already largely familiar with the concepts of version control just not the practice of it.
