##Paste a link to your [USERNAME].github.io repository.

##Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.
1. Go to your Github account main page.
2. Click on the “New Repository” button.
3. Configure the name, privacy, and license settings as you see fit and then click the “Create new repository” button. You now have a new repository!
4. Note the repository URL  window in the middle of the screen.
5.  In your command line navigate to che directory you wish to save the repository in locally. It will look similar to “C:\users\***\***\****\***” with the *** being folder names.
6. Type “git clone *URL from step 4”

##Describe what open source means.
Open source means the software was released under a license that allows anyone to do with the software as they please as long as it does not violate any of the few restrictions of the open source license it was distributed under.

##What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
I think Open Source allows for a lot of innovation and fast development through easy collaboration though there are potential pitfalls. I also feel that the appropriateness of an Open Source license can vary with the project it is being attached to.

##Assess the importance of using licenses.
Licenses are important because they ultimately dictate what others can and can't do with the software you wrote. 

##What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
I am definitely getting more comfortable navigating within the git and Github architecture, though I do need to be more vigilant in starting a feature branch sooner.

##Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
I did not.
