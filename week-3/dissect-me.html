        <p>The domestic cat is a small, typically furry, domesticated, and carnivorous mammal.</p> 
        <p>They are often called house cats when kept as indoor pets or simply cats when there is no need to distinguish them from other felids and felines.[6] Cats are often valued by humans for companionship and for their ability to hunt vermin. There are more than 70 cat breeds; different associations proclaim different numbers according to their standards. The International Progressive Cat Breeders Alliance (IPCBA) recognizes 73 cat breeds while TICA (The International Cat Association) recognizes 58, CFA (The Cat Fanciers' Association) recognizes 44 and Federation International Feline (FIFE) recognizes 43.[7]</p>
        <p>Cats are similar in anatomy to the other felids, with a strong, flexible body, quick reflexes, sharp retractable claws, and teeth adapted to killing small prey. Cat senses fit a crepuscular and predatory ecological niche. Cats can hear sounds too faint or too high in frequency for human ears, such as those made by mice and other small animals. They can see in near darkness. Like most other mammals, cats have poorer color vision and a better sense of smell than humans. Cats, despite being solitary hunters, are a social species and cat communication includes the use of a variety of vocalizations (mewing, purring, trilling, hissing, growling, and grunting), as well as cat pheromones and types of cat-specific body language.[8]</p>

-What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?
We used head as it is required for the meta data and to contain the title for labeling the page within the browser, body to denote the body of the page, header to describe the header element of the page, h* to denote any headers within the page, main to describe the main content containing part of the body, nav to denote the naigation bar, div to denote individual elements, p to describe textcontaining elements, and the footer to describe the footer elementts.

-How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?
Elements are laid out on the page sequentially as they are described within the html code.

-What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist? 
In addition to snippets I learned that I have a lot to learn about Sublime! I haven't used it as much as I would like due to using the Cloud9 ide. Snippets seem as though they could be very useful if implemented properly in a workflow. I will have to research their creation and see what snippets already exist to see if they will work well for me right now.
