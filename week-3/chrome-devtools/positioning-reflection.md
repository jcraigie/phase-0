-How can you use Chrome's DevTools inspector to help you format or position elements?
Chrome's Devtools inspector helps in formatting or positioning elements by providing a live environment that gives immediate feedback on any changes entered.

-How can you resize elements on the DOM using CSS?
By altering the height and width attributes.

-What are the differences between absolute, fixed, static, and relative positioning? Which did you find easiest to use? Which was most difficult?
Absolute positioning effectively removes the element from the DOM and positions it relative to its parent via assigned values. Fixed positioning is independent of any parent element and positions the element relative to the viewport via assigned values. Static positioning is the default positioning for elements and will place them as they would appear in the html flow. Relative positioning places elements relative to their starting point via assigned values without effecting other elements around them and reserving its original space.

-What are the differences between margin, border, and padding?
Padding dictates an area around the content of an element and the border of an element while the border describes the border of the element and the margin is the area between the border of the element and the edge of the element.  

-What was your impression of this challenge overall? (love, hate, and why?)
I liked this challenge because not only did it expose us to a very useful tool it helped to put the material we've been learning into context.
