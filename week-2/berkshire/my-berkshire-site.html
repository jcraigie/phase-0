<!-- 
- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
Very interesting and enlightening.

- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
It was pretty fun actually. So far that is what I am enjoying the most about html; the breadth and accesibility of information that is out there.

- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
As I understand it we failed. Some styling slipped in due to our inability to figure out how to replicate the requested reult otherwise.

- What seems good and bad about HTML?
I really appreciate the straightforward of it. It does what you tell it and once you begin understanding the intent of the various tags and and have a roadmap I felt it works out pretty well
It's results leave a lot to be desired without additional styling i.e. css

- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
Other than the ever ready cheatsheet I have yet to develop any tricks.
