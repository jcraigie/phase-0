###What is a wireframe?
A wireframe is a design tool giving a barebones representation of a websites framework.
###What are the benefits of wireframing?
A wireframe allows the designer(s) to get a better idea of what they want the website to look like and to identify any potential problems or user experience issues early on and allowing for quick changes. Wireframes also have the potential to aid in coding by giving a better roadmap.
###Did you enjoy wireframing your site?
Eventually yes. I was stressed about trying to make something good but eventually relaxed and was able to create something.
###Did you revise your wireframe or stick with your first idea?
There were some revisions.
###What questions did you ask during this challenge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?
I wouldn't say I asked many questions but I did spend time visiting sites I like and viewing them with wirify by Volkside link included in the article.
###Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy and which parts did you find tedious?
I found the actual creation of the wireframes, especially since I had to draw them by hand, to be tedious.
