##What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?
My site would serve as a place to point people to if they were interested in contacting me or seeing what I had done in the past. The site would feature all of the obvious contact info such as email, twitter, linkedin, and what not in addition to portfolios and blog posts regarding prior projects.

##What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?
My target audiences interest will hopefully be me and the things I have done which would be addressed by easily accessible information about me and my projects.

##What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.
The primary action would probably be either looking into past projects, looking for more info on me or looking for contact information and that is facilitated right from the beginning.

##What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?
The main things one should know about user experience are that there is no one single solution, it can be difficult to gauge it's effectiveness and it doesn't necessarily go hand in hand with usability.

##What is user experience design and why is it valuable?
User experience is how the end user of a system, such as a website, feels while interacting with that system and it is valuable because it ultimately meets the users needs and helps to make that system stand out from others like it.

##Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?
Relative pathing. I really didn't thing it would be an issue but I was apparently stymied by it and I took a while to fix my mistake.
