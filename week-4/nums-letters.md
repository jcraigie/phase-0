###What does puts do?
puts prints the output of a program and then generates a new line, it does not return any value.

###What is an integer? What is a float?
An integer is any whole number i.e. a number that isn't a fraction or contain a decimal. A float is a number that contins a decimal.

###What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?
integer division will only return an integer, rounding down, while float will return the answer with a float. Float division is what a calculator would
for you while integer division can be useful in determining how many cats you can buy since you can't easily, legally or morally divide a cat.

```
p 365 * 24
```
```
p ((365 * 24)*60)*10
```
###How does Ruby handle addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of numbers?
Ruby handles addition (+), subtraction(-), multiplication(*), and division(/) of numbers much like a calculator as long as you do not use floats and integers together without 
converting them appropriatly for your desired result.

###What is the difference between integers and floats?
An integer is any whole number i.e. a number that isn't a fraction or contain a decimal. A float is a number that contins a decimal.

###What is the difference between integer and float division?
integer division will only return an integer, rounding down, while float will return the answer with a float if appropriate.

###What are strings? Why and when would you use them?
Strings are groups of letters and are used when working with text.

###What are local variables? Why and when would you use them?
Local variables are assigned a value such as a string or an integer and serve as stand in for that value allowing it to be used easily throughout the code.

###How was this challenge? Did you get a good review of some of the basics?
This challenge was very straight forward and reminded me of the Codecademy material.
