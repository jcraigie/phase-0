#Pseudocode
#take the list of names and desired group size and arguments
#determine names length
#determine number of overflow students that can't be cleanly grouped 
#set a Large Group counter equal to that
#for the number of large groups sample from names the desired number of students + 1 and store in a temporary array
#remove the names in the temp array from the names list
#store the temp array in a hash as the value with an appropriate name for key
#clear the temp array and reset / iterate any counters
#for the remainder of the names list sample from names the desired number of students + 1 and store in a temporary array
#remove the names in the temp array from the names list
#store the temp array in a hash as the value with an appropriate name for key
#clear the temp array and reset / iterate any counters

#What was the most interesting and most difficult part of this challenge?
#The most intereting part was working around the noncleanly divided members and accounting for them in the groups. The most frustrating was figuring out how to get my 
# clear the temporary array so it wouldn't return one set of members as all of the groups. I need to find a better way to do that but ran out of time.

#Do you feel you are improving in your ability to write pseudocode and break the problem down?
#I do. I revisited and revised the psuedocode mutiple times as the problem evolved and I needed to redefine my approach to the problem

#Was your approach for automating this task a good solution? What could have made it even better?
#It works so I suppose it's good. I am sure that there are much more concise and elegant ways to do everything that I did but I am not there yet though
#I did learn a lot from this excercise.

#What data structure did you decide to store the accountability groups in and why?
#I used a hash because I wante to name the groups and it felt right.

#What did you learn in the process of refactoring your initial solution? Did you learn any new Ruby methods?
#I learned about sample and became more familiar with delete
